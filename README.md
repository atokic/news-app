The mobile version is not completely finished. It remains to complete the implemented mobile menu and invite it to appear in the appropriate place.

As for choosing an API from the two APIs offered, I didn't think much. I immediately chose the News API from the link: https://newsapi.org/
and it fetched my news properly, so I didn't even look at the other news api that was offered to me.
